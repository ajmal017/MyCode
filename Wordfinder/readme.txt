The Wordfinder tool will find the longest possible word from a text file of words using the letters of a string up to 12 alphabetic characters.

To run the tool you need to run the script word-finder.php which takes two arguments:
- A local text file that contains all the words to choose from
- A string of at most 12 alphabetic characters

This is an example of the command required to run the tool:

         1                    2                 3
php word-finder.php google-10000-english.txt ekapbccas

Argument 1 is the word-finder.php script
Argument 2 is the text file to be checked against
Argument 3 is the up to 12 letter alphabetic string

The result of running the script should give the longest word that can be generated using the searchString that exists in the text file
